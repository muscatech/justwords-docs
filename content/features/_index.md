### Runs in your web browser

JustWords runs as a Google Chrome extension. Install the extension from
[the Chrome web store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/justwords-for-chrome/bncpjjjjagbmbmaefckmjecknmigphna?pli=1)
to get started.

### Easy to use

A simple and intuitive interface lets you focus on what you're doing, not how
you're doing it. Use your mouse or speed up your workflow with plentiful
keyboard shortcuts.

### Songs are not slides

Most lyric projection software treats songs as a slide deck, forcing you to
break the song up into screenfuls. JustWords stores songs as _songs_ - with
verses, choruses, phrases and so on - and will automatically split them up into
screen-sized chunks depending on your current theme.

### Full-text search across all songs

No need to try and remember the first line of a song, or work out what the last
person called it when they entered it into the system - full-text search will
quickly find any part of any song. You can even jump straight to displaying the
right verse or chorus!

### Easy theming

Customise how your songs, liturgy and Scripture will appear. You can switch
instantly between themes while live, or set certain items to always display with
a particular theme.

### Scripture integration

There's built-in support for showing Bible passages from more than
70 English-language translations including NIV, ESV and KJV. Support for other
languages coming soon!

### Easy to build playlists

The built-in playlist feature lets you quickly build up a list of songs,
liturgy and Scripture readings. You can save and load a playlist too, so you can
prepare ahead of time.

### Sync across all computers (Premium)

With JustWords Premium, all your themes, songs, and liturgy are automatically
synchronised across all computers on your account.

Spot a typo? Fix it once and all your other computers will pick up the change.
