Get started with JustWords in three steps.

## 1. Install the JustWords extension for Google Chrome

JustWords requires the Google Chrome browser. If you don't have it, you can
[install it from Google](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

It may be possible to install and use JustWords using Microsoft Edge, but this
is not officially supported.

You'll need to install the JustWords extension for Chrome on each computer you
want to use JustWords on. If you're signed in to a Google account, Chrome will
automatically install the extension on your other computers.

Click the button below to be taken to the Chrome Web Store:
